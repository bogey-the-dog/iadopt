# iAdopt

iAdopt is a dual-purpose app that gives shelters a way to showcase the animals they want to place, and allows adoptees to find the perfect pet to fill their needs.

#### Technical Specifications

  - Ruby on Rails
  - PostgreSQL
  - Javascript/JQuery
  - AJAX
  - HTML
  - SASS

The application was built with Ruby on Rails and integrated with Javascript/jQuery and AJAX for some of its responsive functions. APIs such as Twitter, Google Maps, Highcharts and Zipwise were used to improve the user experience, therby helping shelters get as much exposure to their adoptable animals as possible.

##### Challenges Faced

Among the challenges I faced throughout this project was the usage of jQuery and AJAX for my moving top bar. Both of those were topics I had less exposure to during Launch Academy, but I intend to turn them into one of my strengths. I made sure to include these concepts in my breakable toy and work through my struggles. It was really fun to figure out how jQuery would work with the css transition property to create the move effect that I have done.

I also used Javascript and AJAX with the integration of Highcharts in my project. It was important to me that visitors could see in realtime which dogs were available at a shelter and what sort of breeds they were. I felt the information displayed in this way added a dynamic effect to the page and was well worth the challenge of its implementation.
