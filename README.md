# iAdopt

iAdopt is a dual purpose app that gives shelters greater exposure to their animals and allows adoptees the way to find the perfect pet to fill their needs.

#### Technical Specifications
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Javascript/JQuery
  - AJAX
  - PostgreSQL
  - HTML
  - SASS

The application was built with Ruby on Rails and integrated with Javascript/JQuery and AJAX for some of the responsive functions. APIs such as Twitter, Google Maps, Highcharts and Zipwise were used to give the shelters as much exposure as possible and generate more movement for their animals.

##### Challenges Faced

Some of the challenges I faced throughout this project was the useage of Jquery and AJAX for my moving top bar. Both of those were something I had the least amount of exposure with during Launch Academy, but I intend to turn them into one of my strengths. I made sure to include them in my breakable toy and work through my struggles. It was extremely interesting to see how jquery would work with the css transition property to create the move effect that I have done.

Again I made sure to use some Javascript and AJAX with the integration of Highcharts within my project. It was important to me that vistors could see in realtime which dogs were available at a shelter and what sort of breeds they were. I felt the information displayed in such a way added a dynamic effect to the page and was well worth the challenge of its implementation.

I'm very proud of what I've created in these past two weeks and I hope that you can take some time to visit it yourself. Thank you!
